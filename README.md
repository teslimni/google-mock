Google-mock
A clone of Google homepage and result page built with Tailwind CSS.
A small project to demonstrate my css chops. Obviously still a lot to learn from my mentor. Using Tailwinds CSS to develop is such a pleasure.
This is obviously for demo only. So when you click in the search box, you'll see a dropdown of pre-populated result suggestions. In a real live/production app, the suggested results will come from a database of an api.
With your cursor still in the focused search box, hit enter to simulate a search. You will be redirected to a mock search result page. Try a searc and the full screen search box with simulated suggested results will pop up for the mobile version.
Enjoy the Google mock app.
